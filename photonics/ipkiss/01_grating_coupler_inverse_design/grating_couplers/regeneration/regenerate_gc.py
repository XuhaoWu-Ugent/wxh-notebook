"""This script regenerates the data used for the circuit model of the optimized Y-branch.
It does this by running the simulation of the Y-branch's layout through the Luceda Link for Ansys Lumerical.
It outputs the simulation result in the data folder for use in the circuit model.
Use this script to replicate the data whenever the layout is updated in order to keep this circuit model in sync.

1. How many wls are used? 
2. 2 parts: blue arrow - laser, orange arrow - laser as well?
    A: 2 directions sweeps one by one 
3. Is the weight set used to control the light direction (working as switch)?

4. note: laser is ready and the rest is simulation, waiting for tape-out back

5. note: add micro-ring modulator result (voltage-power)
6. Complex system - network
page 5
7. multi layers - weight of each layer should be hardware related?
8. Why is there no need to change to weights matrix?
   A: w1=w2=..., by using (random) shuffle to make all of these different - regulation
9. Using shuffle so that the input/output column elements are placed randomly, e.g. X1 - w1 before, after shuffling x1- w2
